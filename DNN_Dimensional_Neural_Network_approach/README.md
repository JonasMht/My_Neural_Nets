# Dimensional neural network approach
**Author**: Jonas Mehtali<br>
I RECKON THIS HAS GREAT POTENTIAL !!!
## Concept:
### Neuron
A neuron entity is composed of a 
### Network Structure:
A n dimensional network composed of single neurons. Each neuron is connected with its spacial neighbours (1d 2 neighbours, 2d 4, 3d 6 ... (n dimension -> 2*n neighbours))
### Path Reinforcement:
Abillity to actively reinforce high traffic paths between neurons such as in ant colonies and pheromone paths leading to a food source.
### Evolution:
The system evolves and corrects itself during periods called "sensory deprivation". These periods accur when the network does errors. The lack of input and the dynamic nature of the network forces it to morph and eventualy attein stability.
### Feed Forward:
